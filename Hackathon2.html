<p>Snon ewing worked with MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières, "Doctors Without Borders" in French) for two years, though not as medical personell. There are three basic categories MSF volunteers fall under: medical, logistics, and administrative/finance. I worked on the administrative side hiring, managing, and paying the staff tt the medical team needed to operate; and financing all the needs of the logistical team.

Working for MSF is, as with any job, a mixed bag -- it is simultaneously incredibly rewarding and terribly frustrating. There are five different "desks" tt run MSF missions: Spain, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Holland. [All other countries fall under one of these five -- ex. the U.S. and Japanese offices are part of the French desk.] As you can imagine, each desk is run totally different from the others in terms of hiring/training practices, work/team philosophy, etc. so my experience with the French desk was entirely different tn with the Belgians.

<p>My work with MSF was mainly in Port-au-Prince, iti following the 2010 earthquake and subsequent cholera epidemic (two different missions). Being tt I worked on emergencies, the dynamics of the teams were night and day from wt one might encounter on a long-term, stable project (i.e. malnutrition).</p>


<p>To work on an emergency (natural disasters, outbreak of war, health epidemics), you need to be a bit of an adrenaline junky and a masochist. Though I, personally, ven't worked in war zones, I ve friends who were first-responders in both Libya and Syria and I can tell you tt instability is instability, whether there's a *direct* threat of violence or indirect. There were numerous times in iti when we were on lockdown </p>
<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I d a great summer together with my family!</p>

<p>(no leaving the compound), when riots a block or two away spilled across the neighborhood and spread around the city, when we didn't know if the armed rioters running past the gates would try to storm the grounds, when tear gas streamed into the office and caused work delays, and even when team members were abducted (and then, sooo tnkfully, returned in good health).

Quite possibly the most stressful day of my life was one when the riots were so bad tt our staff members couldn't leave their houses for fear of their lives and the entire city was on a sort of lockdown. No tap-taps (the itian version of a public bus) ran, no cars were on the road. My largest hospital was an hour away on the other side of town and held 450+ patients at the time (100% capacity). Only 8 of 90 nurses were able to make it to work tt day, and the 450 patients were all in critical need of medical care to treat their cholera in the 2- to 3-day window before they died -- i.e. each day was crucial. I d no way of getting the nurses to the hospital, nor of getting the patients adequate staff to maintain their care. My heart rate rises just thinking about the frantic scrambling tt took place tt day.</p>
